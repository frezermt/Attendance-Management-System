1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Software Configuration Management Plan (SCMP) is to define the configuration management processes, roles, tools, and controls applied to the Attendance Management System project. This document ensures that all project artifacts are systematically identified, controlled, tracked, and audited throughout the software lifecycle.This SCMP follows standard SCM best practices aligned with IEEE 828 guidelines 
1.2 Scope
This SCMP applies to all configuration items (CIs) produced during the development of the Attendance Management System, including:
* Project documentation
* Source code files
* JSON data storage files
* Repository structure
* Change requests
* Baseline records
* Release artifacts
1.3 Project Overview
The Attendance Management System is an simplified web based application with the following core functional capability:
* User login (basic authentication)
* Dashboard displaying system options
* Attendance marking functionality
* JSONbased data storage
The system is implemented using simple web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with data stored in a lightweight JSON file. Project documentation is created using Google Docs to facilitate collaborative drafting and review. 
2. SCM MANAGEMENT
2.1 SCM Objectives
The objectives of SCM for this project are:
* To uniquely identify and manage configuration items
* To control changes systematically
* To maintain baselines at defined milestones
* To provide configuration status visibility
* To ensure auditability and traceability

	3. CONFIGURATION IDENTIFICATION
3.1 Configuration Items (CIs)
Configuration Items include all artifacts that require control. These are grouped into:
* Documents
* Source Code
* Data Files
* Repository Assets
Each CI is uniquely named, versioned, and tracked.
3.2 CI Naming Conventions
CI Type
	Naming Convention
	Example
	Documents
	<DocName>_<Project>_vX.X
	SCMP_AMS_v1.0
	Source Code
	lowercase_with_underscores
	login.html
	JSON Data
	descriptive_name.json
	attendance_data.json
	Change Requests
	CRXXX
	CR001
	

3.3 Versioning Rules
The project follows semantic versioning:
* Major: Significant functional milestone
* Minor: Approved change requests
* Patch: Documentation or formatting fixes
Example: v1.0, v1.1
3.4 Git Branching Strategy
The project follows a simple and controlled Git branching strategy to support parallel development while maintaining configuration stability. The main branch represents the latest approved and stable baseline. All development activities are conducted in isolated feature branches to prevent direct modification of the stable configuration.
The following branches are used:
* main: Contains approved baselines and releaseready artifacts
* Feature login: Development and updates related to login functionality
* Feature attendance: Development and updates related to attendance marking logic
Feature branches are merged into the main branch only after review and approval, ensuring traceability, auditability, and configuration integrity.
4. CONFIGURATION CONTROL
4.1 Change Control Process
All changes must follow a formal change control procedure:
1. Change Request (CR) submission
2. Impact analysis
3. Change Control Board (CCB) review and approval
4. Implementation
5. Verification
6. Baseline update (if applicable)
Unapproved changes are not permitted.
4.2 Change Control Board (CCB)
The Change Control Board consists of:
* Project Manager
* SCM Manager
* QA Engineer
The CCB ensures that changes do not negatively affect scope, schedule, or baseline integrity.
4.3 Change Classification
All change requests are classified to ensure appropriate evaluation and approval. The project recognizes the following change categories:
* Minor Change: Documentation updates, formatting corrections, or small user interface adjustments with no functional impact.
* Major Change: Functional modifications affecting attendance logic, data handling, or system behavior.
* Emergency Change: Critical fixes required to resolve system failures or data inconsistencies.
Change classification assists the Change Control Board (CCB) in determining approval priority and implementation strategy.
5. CONFIGURATION STATUS ACCOUNTING
Configuration status accounting ensures that:
* CI versions are traceable
* Change implementation status is visible
* Baselines are documented
Status information is maintained through:
* Configuration Item Register
* Change Log
* Git commit history
6. BASELINE MANAGEMENT
6.1 Baseline Definition
A baseline represents a formally approved configuration snapshot.
Planned baselines include:
* BL1: Initial repository setup and documentation
* BL2: Working prototype with approved change requests implemented
6.2 Baseline Control
Baselines are:
* Tagged in Git
* Documented formally
* Modified only through approved change requests
7. CONFIGURATION AUDITS
7.1 Audit Types
Two audit types are conducted:
* Physical Configuration Audit (PCA)
 Verifies the presence, correctness, and version consistency of configuration items.
* Functional Configuration Audit (FCA)
 Confirms that functional requirements are correctly implemented and traceable.
Audit results are documented in the Configuration Audit Report.
